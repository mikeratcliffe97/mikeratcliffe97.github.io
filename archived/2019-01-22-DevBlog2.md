<b>January</b>

Before the new year and into early January, I was working extending on my BasicReborn text adventure game and I'm really pleased with it.
I made two versions, one inspired by Alien and Dead Space, in which the player has to navigate a space ship; and another based in a forest. <br>
I've still got to get used to file handling within ASGE and I'm planning to use it within my current group project, a platformer based on the film, Ex Machina. <br>
As I wrote my post mortem for Basic Reborn, I realised although I was satisfied with the technical element of my game, the look and feel was plain so I'm striving to improve that in my current project.
In Ex Machina, I'm working as the lead programmer and learning lots about project management as well as version control. 

I also finished my tabletop **[game](https://youtu.be/Ku7eDkWR12o)** in a group project and was really pleased with it. I'll eventually be digitising this into a turn-based game across a network, so I'm beginning to research networking in games.
