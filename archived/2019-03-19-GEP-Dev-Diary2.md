# Pre-beta

After working hard the last few weeks, we submitted our beta build and presented some of our features in a viva presentation.
I've been working on scaling the 3D models and assisting my team member with applying physics components to them, so they can move like cars.

## Main Features

Although we don't have many gameplay features, lots of systems have been started. 
We have:
- 4 player split screen
- controller support
- 3D track loaded
- Player kart loaded

There's a lot of work to be done but I'm pleased with the progress we've made.
