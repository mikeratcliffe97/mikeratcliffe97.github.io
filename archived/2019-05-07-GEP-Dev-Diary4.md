# Final Lap
## Last post before submission!

There's just a few days until this project is due.
We've finally managed to get physics and collisions working (just) with the 3D models.
Unfortunately, this might be too late to get proper bounding boxes set up with the track and allow proper gameplay.
Steering has been changed to feel more like a racing game.
This is a shame as we have an AI system that could be integrated.
The last few days have just been bug fixing and optimisation. Pre-build directives have been set up to allow the game to run on a Vanilla machine and the arcade machine in the lab and hopefully these will run with the final version.
Hopefully we'll round off some of the features we have already and make sure what is implented works properly.
