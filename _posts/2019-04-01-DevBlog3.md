<b>April</b>

Since my last update, I've discovered networking in video games is <b> difficult </b>.
I've been working on my last programming group assignment for the year, digitising a tabletop game into a turn-based game over a network.
The game needs to feature gameplay as well as a chat room for players to communicate. 
Fortunately, the tabletop game is designed so that as a video game (see last blog **[post](https://mikeratcliffe97.github.io/DevBlog2/)**) , very little information is needed to be sent over a network for the game to function properly. 

However, I've been helping design a class based scene manager, as well as converting lots of the physical aspects of the last game into digital file formats, specifically .json files (more file handling!) to optimise the code (it currently reads in 60+ .pngs). We also have audio implemented with some spooky scifi music. 

Really looking forward to finishing it off!
