## <b>Ready for work</b>

2024 was a huge year for me. I officially moved to the USA and married my best friend. 
Leaving the UK was daunting. Saying goodbye to my friends and family as well as my professional network was hard.
Since gaining the right to work here, I've slowly been building up a new network here and working as a consultant and a contractor.

I've done AV work at amazing events, such as the International AI Safety Summit in San Francisco's Presidio (Fei Fei Li was there!). I've also installed network equipment and supported hundreds of people at 'in-towns'for global climate non-profits. 
These experiences have given me a great perspective on professional life in this country.

One of the reasons (other than <i>love<i/>) I wanted to move to the Bay was because of the incredible opportunities in this part of the world.

<b>I can't wait<b/> for the opportunity to get back to something I'm passionate about. Developing new and innovative products. Spending long hours each day making something I care about.

## Looking for Work

If you've made it here, I've probably applied for a role in your business.
Let's talk about why it's a good decision.
