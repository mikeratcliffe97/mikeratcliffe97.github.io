# Virtual Emergencies
In May 2021 I was approached by clinicians from an NHS trust in England to discuss developing a training simulator for student doctors.

## Brief
The clinicians wanted students to be able to practice medical procedures in a safe environment without the need for actors or the risk of harming real patients.
[br] Immediately, I knew that this could be achieved in a virtual space and jumped at the chance to take on this project.
After some scoping meetings, we decided that the project should have the functionality to:
* allow the user to move around and interact with objects in a virtual space, styled on a resuscitation room
* apply objects to a patient model 
    * (e.g. medicine and medical apparatus)
* interact with other NPC models and instruct them to perform tasks 
    * (e.g. preparing medical apparatus for the user to use)
* have the patient react to tasks with real-time visual and audio feedback 
    * (e.g. heartrate increasing on a monitor, patient fitting/spasming)


## Prototype
<br> I set to work to find assets and build a prototype, with medical apparatus, <b>very<b></b> basic UI and object interaction. 
<br>This was my first progress video for the client -

Client was impressed with the prototype and we decided on a project plan for the rest of the development.
