I've made a <b>Space Invaders</b> game in the AwesomeSauceGameEngine, written in C++.
I learnt a lot developing this including:<br />
How to utitlise Git features properly <br />
Use of Enum Classes in switch cases. <br />
Use of Sine and Quadratic Formulaes within games
<!--more-->

Here are some screenshots of my menu, my quadratic game mode which uses a quadratic formula and my standard gamemode.
