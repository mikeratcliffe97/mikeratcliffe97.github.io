Welcome!
This is my first developer update blog, a chance to write about what I'm working on and things I'm learning.
<b>University</b>
Before the new year and into early January, I was working on my BasicReborn text adventure game and I'm really pleased with it.
I made two versions, one inspired by Alien and Dead Space, in which the player has to navigate a space ship; and another based in a forest.
I've still got to get used to file handling within ASGE and I'm planning to use it within my new group project, a platformer based on the film, Ex Machina.

I also finished my tabletop **[game](https://youtu.be/Ku7eDkWR12o)** in a group project and was really pleased with it.

<b>Not University</b>

I've fallen back in love with Hearts of Iron 4 and am very excited for the new DLC.
Also Foals have just released new music which is very chill and ambient, ideal for coding.
