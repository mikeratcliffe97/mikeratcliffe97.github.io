# Welcome

<b> September </b>
Welcome to my dev blog. I'll be updating this periodically throughout the year to track my progress and learning on my course.
Over summer, I attempted to make a version of Snake in ASGE which I will update and potentially post at some point.

This year I'm hoping to improve my knowledge of C++, specifically:

- file handling
- scene management
- classes

My first assignment is a C++ port of a text adventure game written in Basic.<br>
It has been interesting learning how Basic works as a language, although I'm happy to stick with C and C++.
