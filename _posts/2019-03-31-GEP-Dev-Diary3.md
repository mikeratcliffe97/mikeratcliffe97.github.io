# Beta Feedback

Our feedback for the beta has given us lots to work on. 
As mentioned in that last post, we have a lot of systems in place that need to be bulked out and our feedback reflected.

Going forward we need to work on streamlining our engine and relying less on hard coding elements. 
We also need to finish our physics system so we can start working on other features like AI and lap mechanics.
