# Audio Visual Production

This week in AVP, I was asked to list my skillset and what I would bring to a group to deliver a project.

## Technical Skills

My relevant skills for an AVP Project are:

-Video Editing (Intermediate)<br>
-3D Design/Modelling for VR (Basic)<br>
-Coding/Scripting (Intermediate)<br>
-Level Design (Intermediate)<br>
-Storyboarding (Intermediate)<br>
-Planning/Project Management (Advanced)<br>

To improve, I could look into 360 video and link it with my experience in 3D modelling.
As well as this, I would like to improve my filming and audio.

## Personal Skills

As tasked, I completed a personality test online and got the result of 'Mediator' which states that I am creative, hard-working, flexible and passionate about projects.
This fits well with my skill set, as I enjoy project management and conflict resolution within groups and like to ensure everyone is comfortable with their tasks and can pitch in with ideas.
As well as this, I am a creative person so this fits in with my skills in storyboarding and level design.

I'm looking forward to the assignment and working as a group to produce a 3-5 minute audio visual production.
