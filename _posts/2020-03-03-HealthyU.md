  Designing a health and fitness app through gamification and personalised avatars
 </figure>
 
<b>HealthyU</b> is my dissertation project. I wanted to see if designing an app to improve health and wellbeing in students and young adults using game design methods was viable.

The app tries to encourage healthy lifestyle choices through gameplay.

## Sleep
One of the habits I wanted to encourage was healthy sleep routines. This is proven to have a good impact on psychical and mental health.
To accomplish this, the app features a sleep calculator and a sleep tracking graph.

These were simple enough to design so I will not share the code - however, this allows the user to view and track their own sleeping patterns as well as work out when to sleep/wake up in order to get the recommended amount of sleep each night.
## Avatar

In order to maintain user engagement and fulfill a user's need for social interaction - I decided to implement a basic virtual avatar
