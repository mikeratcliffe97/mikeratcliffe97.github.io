# Back in My Day

<b>Back In My Day </b>(BIMD) is an exploration of the underground music scene in Bristol over the last 30 years. <br>The original idea for the project was to recreate parts of the city based on archive images from the past, to allow users to see how Bristol has changed and expanded throughout time. However, as a group and with feedback from lecturers, we realised it would be difficult to make this interesting and fun within the scope of the project.
Based on research into other successful VR projects, we decided to run with the popular VR format of live concerts and give it a historical aspect. 
Bristol is renowned for its contributions to musical genres such as drum ‘n’ bass and triphop. There are many projects based in the city to educate people about the history of these genres as well as the people that are associated with them. <br>We wanted to expand on these projects and build an experience that would educate younger audiences about what people were listening to in the past and why; as well as allow older audiences who were part of the subcultures to reminisce. 

In the experience, the user can visit three famous Bristol venues: <a href="https://lakota.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lakota</a>, the <a href="https://www.trinitybristol.org.uk/" target="_blank">Trinity Centre</a> and <a href="https://thefleece.co.uk/" target="_blank">The Fleece</a>. 
Each venue features a song from a Bristol based artist that is related to the venue. Lakota features the song ‘Dancehall Tornado’ by the house DJ duo, Way Out West. The Trinity Centre features ‘Brown Paper Bag’ by Roni Size and the Fleece features ‘Danny Nedelko’ by the band Idles. The venues are accessed through a poster board style interface, where the user can select which venue they want to visit using the VR controller.
One of my main contributions was to the project was the research and creative decisions, which made sure the experience was accurate and authentic; as well as appealing to all audiences.

Part of the VR experience is a brief introduction for the user as they enter each venue. This gives them some information about the venue they are in as well as some information about the song that is playing and why it is influential in the Bristol music scene. As I had conducted the interviews and visited the venues, I put myself forward to write these introductions. <br>After consulting with a script writer in February, I had planned to write extensive scripts for each scene and create events based on real life accounts interviews. However, due to the limitations of the university closing and completing the project from home, I was not able to accomplish this. 
<br>This is disappointing as it would have made the project feel more realistic and given each scene more character. <br>Despite this, the finished narrative scripts give the user a good outline of the history of each venue and its place within the underground music scene in Bristol; as well as an insight into why each song was chosen and similarly, the impact of each song on the music scene.
