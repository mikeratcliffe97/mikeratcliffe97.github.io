## <b>Can you please explain the gap on your resume?</b>

In April 2022, I set off on a trip around the world with my best friend. I'd been aching to travel since covid, and managed to save up a good amount which meant I could work remotely on projects for getUBetter and on my VR projects.

In 8 months, I travelled to 14 new countries and a total of <b>237</b> new cities, across North and South America, South East Asia, and Oceania. It's been an amazing experience and I'm so grateful to have been able to make this trip.


## Looking for Work

While remote working from the side of the pool or the backseats of a car during long road trips has been great, I'm now excited to get back to work and apply my skills to new projects, whether freelance or as part of a company. Please have a look around my projects.
I'm looking for roles in digital project management or as product owner.
Please get in touch if you'd like to discuss any opportunities with me and I'll be happy to send a copy of my resume.
